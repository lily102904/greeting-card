# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project Overview:
The "Greeting Cards" project is a React app built using Vite and Tailwind CSS. It focuses on creating components, passing props, and styling the app using a utility-first CSS framework.

# Objectives:
- Create three components: "Header", "GreetingCard", and "main".
- Pass data (title and message) to "GreetingCard" via props.
- Style the app using "Tailwind CSS" for a responsive, modern look.

# Key Learnings:
- React Basics: Creating functional components and passing props.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Quickly styling components with utility classes.
- Vite: Setting up and using a fast development environment.
- **Problem-Solving**: Debugging import errors and styling issues.

This project helped me improve my skills in React, CSS, and modern web development tools.

Working on the "Greeting Cards" project was both challenging and rewarding. While creating React components and using Tailwind CSS, I encountered issues with file imports and styling integration. These challenges tested my problem-solving skills but ultimately helped me gain a deeper understanding of React and modern web development tools like Vite. Although it wasn't easy, the project was a great learning experience that strengthened my skills.
